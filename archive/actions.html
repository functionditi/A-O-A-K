        <h2>GESTURES</h2>
        <p>
          

          Controlling the Flow: <br>By adjusting the pressure between the fingers, the artist controls the steady trickle of powder. The thumb acts as a gatekeeper, regulating the amount released.<br><br>
          Refilling Technique:<br> Without interrupting the flow, the artist skillfully replenishes the powder by scooping more into the hand, maintaining the same grip.<br><br>
          
          Smooth Movements: <br>The hand moves in fluid motions to create straight lines, curves, and loops. The steadiness of the hand ensures clean, continuous lines.<br><br>
          Wrist and Arm Coordination: <br> The wrist provides flexibility for intricate curves, while the arm moves guide larger strokes and transitions across the design.<br><br>
          Pressure Variation: <br> Subtle changes in finger pressure can adjust the thickness of the lines, adding depth and variation to the pattern.

        <h2>POSTURE</h2>
        <p>
          Stance: <br>Artists may stand, squat, or sit while drawing, depending on the size of the kolam and personal comfort. <br><br>
Balance:<br> Maintaining a stable posture is crucial, as the artist often stretches to reach different parts of the design, and attempts to not smudge the kolam!<br><br>
Breath Control: <br>Some artists synchronize their breathing with their movements, enhancing focus and steadiness.<br><br>
Rhythmic Motion: <br>Experienced artists develop a rhythm in their gestures, which contributes to the symmetry and harmony of the kolam.<br><br>
Memory and Improvisation: <br>While many designs are traditional, artists often draw from memory or improvise, relying on muscle memory and intuition in their hand movements.

        <h2>ADAPTATION</h2>
        <p>
          Alternative Materials: <br> While traditional kolams are drawn freehand with powder, some artists use tools like stencils or pens for precision, especially in contemporary adaptations.<br><br>
Innovations:<br> Modern variations might involve colored powders or paints, requiring adjustments in hand techniques to accommodate different textures and mediums.<br><br>

      </div>

      <div class="column textbox">

        <h2>MATERIALS</h2>
        <p>
          Rice Flour: <br> Rice flour is the primary material for creating kolams, trickled between the middle and index fingers with the thumb guiding the flow <br><br>
Chalk:<br> In urban settings where rice flour might be less practical due to foot traffic, chalk sticks or chalk powder is used.<br><br>
Synthetic Color: <br>Colored kolams are particularly popular during festivals like Pongal, Diwali, and weddings.

        <h2>EXPERIMENT</h2>
        <p>
         
          Exploring Kolams as an outcome of the artist's in-the-moment
interactions with the medium, and further exploring how alternate
forms of tangible interaction (e.g. a Wii Nunchuck) can result in
alternate forms of a Kolam. Furthermore, investigating how the
improvisational hand movements used in kolam-making can be
captured and translated into digital inputs.
