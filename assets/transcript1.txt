Aditi: Thank you so much for joining this call. I'm Aditi, a creative technologist currently based in Singapore, originally from Bangalore. I'm half Telugu, half Bengali. I've been following your work for a while and noticed how Telugu cultural elements, like creating a kolam or muggulu, are deeply present in it.

Aarati: I was researching kolams and came across Dr. Gift Siromoney’s work, as well as other mathematicians studying kolams. At the same time, I was thinking about encryption—not just as a way to store or transmit data, but as a ritual itself. Kolams have been a regular practice in my family. Traditionally created by women, they are an art form in their own right. My interest in connecting kolams with encryption began when my grandmother passed away. I wanted to encrypt her name into a kolam as a mourning ritual for myself. The existing mourning rituals in my family followed a more patriarchal lineage, honoring my grandmother’s mother-in-law and her mother-in-law’s mother-in-law. I wanted to take a different approach and honor the maternal lineage instead.

Aditi: That’s fascinating. Before starting this project, I was interested in conditional design—a concept where a set of instructions guides the creation of an artwork, similar to Sol LeWitt’s approach. In our case, these instructions are embedded in daily rituals, passed down through generations. My parents weren’t deeply immersed in culture or religion, so this project—exploring kolams through tangible interactions and human-machine interaction—feels like a process of rediscovery. I wouldn’t call it reclaiming, but rather reconnecting. Since kolams are passed down matrilineally, I’m curious about how you’ve navigated bringing this lineage into public conversations through art and technology. It often feels like a hidden practice—does it feel that way to you? How has translating this into your art been received?

Aarati: Since working on the project with my grandmother, I’ve expanded the types of messages encrypted in kolams. People have reached out with requests for custom kolams, and I now create prints with messages spanning various themes. Some kolams contain personal dedications to family members, while others hold political messages—for instance, one says, From the river to the sea in reference to Palestine. The project has evolved to incorporate different narratives, allowing me to expand its reach and impact. I don't know. Did that answer the question?

Aditi: Yeah, I was asking how you've navigated bringing this lineage into a more public or collective space, engaging with people who may not have seen kolams before. Does that make sense?

Aarati: Yeah. A few things have been helpful. It's definitely interesting bringing something that, while not exactly a secret, is traditionally practiced in a domestic space and then moving it into a gallery. There’s something funny about that. What has helped, especially with the computational kolams, is having so much of the project exist online, through a screen, or as two-dimensional prints. But actually performing the act—drawing kolams on the ground with rice flour—has been really helpful for giving context. The most recent iteration at Spill was interesting because Spill is technically someone’s home, which brings the practice back to a domestic space.

Aditi: That’s great, because the placement of a kolam or rangoli is so important—it’s usually at the threshold of a space. So it's really cool that you did it in someone’s home. I also wanted to ask about the embodiment and physicality of drawing a kolam. I did a visual study where I tried to understand the gestures, the pinching technique, and the materials used. Growing up in Bangalore, I saw kolams all the time in my neighbors’ homes, but my own household never practiced it. In Singapore, space is limited, so people don’t always have free access to corridors or hallways where kolams would typically be drawn. I noticed in one of your Instagram posts that you etched a kolam into a banana leaf, which I thought was really interesting. I’m trying to understand how the physicality of a kolam is tied to its existence. If a kolam isn’t constructed with the same craftsmanship or technique, is it still valid? If there’s a spectrum between traditional kolams and more screen-based versions, where does validity lie? That’s the underlying question I’m exploring.

Aarati: As I developed the web-based part of the project, I realized that time is a really important element. Even the prints I made take a long time because of the tile-based system I use for letterpress printing. Drawing a kolam on the ground also takes time. The physical act of drawing is meditative. I’m not very religious, and I have ethical issues with the way my family practices religion, but I still see value in the act of slowing down and making something. That idea translated into the digital space as well. When I was thinking about how to decode the kolams, I intentionally avoided just putting a label on them. Instead, I made a website where users have to touch every tile or point to decode it. The point isn’t just to read the kolam—the time spent interacting with it becomes a form of meditation or reverence for the message or name embedded in it.

Aditi: That resonates with me. When I was drawing kolams with pen and paper, I started by placing the grid of dots, then challenged myself to connect everything with a single continuous line. I turned it into a game—symmetry was one aspect, but I also experimented with increasing the number of dots and testing different ways to construct the kolam. I completely understand what you mean about the meditative process, whether it’s physical or digital. I also wanted to ask about the translation process. You started by translating your grandmother’s name into a kolam—was that the first one? Were there any trade-offs or tensions that came up when you were encoding the kolam in binary?

Aarati: There were a lot of interesting rabbit holes in how non-Latin characters are encoded in binary. If I translated my grandmother’s name in Telugu script, it became much more complex because of how non-Latin characters are structured. In binary, Latin characters are encoded with 8 digits per letter. But in Telugu, what we consider one letter can take 16 or 24 digits because of how the script is adapted to fit a system optimized for Latin characters. That exposed some of the biases in character encoding systems. Another trade-off was the orientation of the kolams. Traditional kolams are drawn in a radial manner, not in a strict top-to-bottom, left-to-right order like the ones I created. If I redid the project, I’d want to find a way to make them feel less directional.

Aditi: That makes sense. I was trying to write a p5.js script that mimicked the flow of how a kolam is drawn rather than using a tile-based approach. When I draw by hand, it feels intuitive, but with code, I have to break everything into structured instructions. You mentioned making your kolams top-to-bottom and left-to-right—there are so many ways to generate a kolam, but when working with technology, you have to collaborate with it rather than just doing it freely. I’m trying to find ways to bring authenticity into my project while working within these constraints. A follow-up question: How do you balance the strict structure that code requires with the creative and intuitive choices of the process?

Aarati: With kolams, I didn’t have a regular practice of drawing them before, so I was learning while coding. Breaking things into concrete steps for the program was also a way for me to understand kolam structures better. It didn’t feel like a balancing act so much as a deeper exploration. But yes, the process highlights the difference between learning through muscle memory versus over-theorizing through structured instructions.

Aditi: Do you have a background in computer science, coding, mathematics, or design? How did you get into creative technology and computational design?

Aarati: I studied industrial design as an undergrad, then learned to code at a boot camp. I started making websites, which eventually folded into my creative practice. Later, I went to grad school for creative coding and design technology.

Aditi: Do you speak or write Telugu?

Aarati: I’m not fluent, but I know a little of both.

Aditi: I feel like navigating our connection to culture is interesting, especially in more Westernized environments. Do you think computation is inherently Western, given the way character encoding favors Latin characters? How can artists and technologists decolonize these tools?

Aarati: Binary systems exist outside the West—like in Yoruba Ifá traditions and the I Ching in China. Computation isn’t inherently Western; it’s just been framed that way. Expanding our understanding of computation reveals multi-vocality—kolams are a form of coding. Even though I work in New York, I see similar traditions from other cultures, which broadens the conversation.

Aditi: Do you show your work to your family?

Aarati: Not frequently, but they saw my exhibition yesterday. They’re supportive but sometimes confused. My aunt even gave me a tutorial before I performed a kolam. They see it more as a math problem than as art, but they’re willing to engage, which leads to interesting conversations.

Aditi: Just now, you mentioned the act of performing the making of a kolam. We've also talked about physicality and how meditative that process can be. Could you tell me more about your experience with it from a performance art perspective?

Aarati: Yeah, I think this relates to your earlier question about bringing the kolam into an art world space and giving people context for it. I’ve been calling the drawing of it a performance mainly because in spaces where people don’t necessarily have a context for it, it helps set expectations. It signals that something physical is going to happen—someone is going to do something with their body, and there’s a process involved that people will witness. That framing has been helpful in preparing people for what they’re about to see. When I’m actually drawing, seeing the process in action helps people understand how it works. The computational aspect is very tile-like, but when someone sees it being drawn—how the lines connect—it just clicks for them more easily.

Aditi: That makes sense. One thing I’ve been really interested in is the ephemeral nature of kolams or rangolis—the act of making one every day and then having it wiped away as the day progresses. It dissipates, rather than disintegrates. I’ve been thinking about how to translate that aspect into physical computing or interactive experiences where people in Singapore can create their own kolams and understand the practice. Does that ephemeral quality play a role in how you translate kolams into digital or gallery spaces?

Aarati: In some ways, the prints and web-based parts of my project are quite different from the ephemeral nature of an actual kolam on the ground. But I think there’s still something about the generative aspect—how you can have nearly infinite permutations—that relates to that ephemeral quality. The process of constant creation and variation feels connected to the traditional practice, even if the medium is different. That’s also why it was important for me to draw one in the space rather than just having screens or printed pieces. Seeing the kolam change over time is crucial to understanding its nature.

Aditi: Yeah, especially in a Western gallery context, which is very much about the "white cube"—look, don’t touch.

Aarati: Exactly. This time, we were able to do it on the ground, which was nice. But in other spaces, I’ve had to use a platform because there was no way to draw directly on the floor.

Aditi: That makes sense. After all your experimentations and experiences with creating kolam codes, what’s your favorite part of it? What do you enjoy the most?

Aarati: I think expanding the project to involve other people has been really fulfilling. People have asked me to make prints for them, and for the exhibition, we invited Sai Priya, who runs the archive, to create a zine that we included in the space. The conversations I’ve had and the people I’ve met and collaborated with have been the most exciting part.
