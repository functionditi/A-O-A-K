Vijaya: SingaRangoli is my company. Before that, it was varnamila.com. It started in 2007 or 2008. In 2015, I began experimenting with a lot of innovations, so I renamed it SingaRangoli.

Aditi: My name is Aditi. I moved to Singapore four years ago. I studied design communication at LASALLE College of the Arts, which is very close by. I now work at a research studio funded by the Singapore Institute of Technology. Alongside that, I’m working with the Singapore Art Museum on a design research fellowship. I have a background in technology and design, and my current project explores how traditional art forms, such as rangolis, can survive and evolve in a world dominated by technology. I was curious about the rangoli scene in Singapore and did some research. My mother was Bengali, and my father is Telugu, so I grew up with a mix of cultural influences. At home in Bangalore, we only created kolams or muggu during Deepavali, not on a daily basis. Last Deepavali, I had a question: how has this art form evolved in Singapore, where space is limited? Many households don’t have driveways, unlike in India. I’m curious about how rangoli is practiced here and how technology can assist in its creation while preserving its handcrafted nature. Thank you for agreeing to this interview. I understand you hold a Guinness World Record from 2003 in Wampoa, Singapore. My first question is: when did you start creating rangolis in Singapore?

Vijaya: I started making rangolis at the age of five, learning from my mother. We created them outside our house every day. I was born and raised in Trichy, Srirangam, a small town in Tamil Nadu. During the Margazhi festival, we made elaborate, large designs. I would walk through the streets, taking note of new designs I hadn’t seen before. That became my practice as a child. After I got married, I moved to Mumbai. Even though we lived in a flat, I continued to draw small rangolis outside every day. One of my lecturers at Bombay University was impressed with my designs and invited me to draw rangolis at events whenever international guests visited. I created rangolis in hotels and venues like the Nehru Planetarium. I migrated to Singapore with my family in 1992. We lived in a flat, but I maintained my daily ritual: waking up, cleaning the doorstep, and creating a small rangoli with rice powder. The most fulfilling part was seeing birds come to eat the rice powder each morning. Rangoli has many meanings and purposes. I became deeply invested in learning about it—how people practice it in different states of India, the various techniques used, and the reasons behind each tradition. Rangoli has different names across regions, like muggu in Andhra Pradesh. Even in Africa, there are similar practices where people create nature-based rangolis using stones and other materials for festivals. While in Singapore, I pursued a master’s degree in art therapy at LASALLE in 2006–2007. I began incorporating rangoli as a therapeutic practice in hospitals, old-age homes, and children’s homes. Even now, I continue using rangoli in therapy. From 2015 onward, I focused on community involvement—teaching Singapore’s multi-racial communities how to create rangoli art. I transitioned rangoli from floors to tables, then from tables to walls, and now even to ceilings. It remains a traditional design, but I use contemporary materials. More recently, I’ve incorporated recycled materials due to the growing focus on sustainability. Seeing so much waste, I began repurposing discarded items into decorative rangoli art.

Aditi: I think the exhibition you have right now is a great example of cross-cultural expression in Singapore. You’ve combined Ang Paos, which are traditionally Chinese, with Deepavali and rangoli. What was the process like for creating this exhibit?

Vijaya: I have collaborated with around 20 organizations. I am currently the president of the Rotary Club of Novena, but even before that, I engaged in numerous community projects. I organize about four to five projects a year. I enjoy involving the community and working with various materials, including earbuds, toothpicks, spoons, forks, small mirrors, and even clay pots from India. I also designed a puzzle rangoli for stroke and dementia patients, allowing them to interact with and assemble the artwork.

Aditi: What is your process for making them weatherproof? Do you spray them with a fixative?

Vijaya: I use a special glue. My husband is a chemical technologist specializing in adhesives. He developed a unique glue formula, which I use to assemble and color the materials before arranging them into rangoli designs. This method ensures durability, allowing the rangoli to remain intact for months.

Aditi: You mentioned that when you were younger, you observed different types of rangolis and researched them across different countries. For this exhibition, how do you decide on the design of the rangoli?

Vijaya: I adapt based on the crowd. I often work with seniors, individuals with mental illnesses, and people with special needs. I first teach them to create roses by rolling Ang Paos. Once they finish making the roses, I design the layout and guide them in pasting the roses onto the rangoli. I cannot teach them everything in a day, and they may not have the patience to learn rangoli in its entirety. But involving them in the creation itself is significant. That’s why I structure my workshops this way. I am also a member of the International Flower Carpet Association. In 2022, I was invited to join after showcasing my work in Brazil and Brussels. In Brussels, they create massive flower carpets outside the palace, spanning 100–200 meters with thousands of participants. The president of the association saw my work and invited me to be a part of the Brussels Flower Carpet from 2022 onwards. Since then, I have traveled to Japan, Barcelona, Mexico, Italy, and Rome, among other countries, to create rangolis. Recently, I was invited to Florida, but I had to decline due to Deepavali commitments in Singapore. I prioritize decorating for Deepavali here before taking on international projects. From Deepavali until Pongal, I do not travel, as I focus on community exhibitions, migrant worker outreach, and cultural programs, including clapping yoga for seniors and migrant workers.

Aditi: It seems like you use rangoli as a medium to bond with the community.

Vijaya: Yes, I also use it as a therapeutic tool. I organized a large exhibition at Sengkang Hospital, Bright Vision Hospital, and Singapore General Hospital. I worked with patients, doctors, and visitors who were coming in for appointments. They would do rangoli before their appointments and then go back. Seniors often come early for their appointments and feel anxious about their health conditions. After doing rangoli, they felt very happy and relaxed. Many of them asked me why I couldn’t be there permanently because they found it so calming.

Aditi: I read one of your interviews in The Straits Times where you mentioned that making rangolis is very meditative and calming. I have been studying the history of the gestures used in rangoli, particularly when working with traditional materials like rice flour, as well as synthetic colored powders used today. What are your thoughts on the meditative aspect of rangoli? How long does it typically take you to create one?

Vijaya: Symmetry is very important in rangoli, especially for pooja. Creating symmetrical patterns involves repetition, which helps compose the brain and increase focus. The process requires full attention—you forget everything else while working on a symmetrical design. It is similar to yoga. When you press your fingers together in a Chin Mudra, it stimulates the five elements—air, earth, fire, water, and space—because all our fingertips correspond to different elements. The colors of the rangoli enter through the eyes, stimulating the nervous system and chakras. Visually and sensory-wise, it provides stimulation. Emotionally, seeing the finished product brings happiness and satisfaction. The entire process offers emotional balance, psychological well-being, and physical engagement.

Aditi: Rangoli-making is quite physical, isn’t it?

Vijaya: Yes, because you have to bend and work on it. I am 65 years old, and I can still bend for 8 hours, though I do it less now due to surgery. But with practice, it becomes second nature. The process itself brings happiness.

Aditi: Rangolis are not permanent. How do you view this impermanence?

Vijaya: Beauty is not permanent; it is temporary. That is the underlying concept. Spiritually, it is an offering to God, a form of thanksgiving. You cannot take it with you. It is about appreciating the moment and expressing gratitude for the opportunity to create something beautiful. There are also deeper lessons—when you bend to make a rangoli, you are practicing humility and learning to adapt to situations in life. Traditionally, early morning rangoli-making with rice flour feeds small insects like ants and birds. Charity begins in the morning.

Aditi: That’s interesting! I initially thought it was a pest control method.

Vijaya: Yes, in traditional practices, cow dung was used to clean outdoor spaces. It acts as a natural pesticide, keeping away cockroaches, flies, and mosquitoes.

Aditi: There are different levels of traditionality. I also read that rangolis can indicate the health of a household.

Vijaya: Yes, it is believed that drawing a rangoli in the morning drives away evil spirits. It also invites divine blessings. Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, is believed to enter a house adorned with rangoli. Squares are associated with her seat. Upward triangles symbolize males, while downward triangles symbolize females.

Aditi: When technology is integrated into rangoli-making, do you think it affects authenticity? What do you consider the essence of a rangoli?

Vijaya: Rangoli is nature-inspired design. People now refer to similar patterns as mandalas or Zentangles, but these designs have always existed. Rangolis follow specific patterns for different occasions and days. For example, on Fridays, we create Padi Kolam. During festivals like Deepavali, we design rangolis to bring joy to visitors. Today, even portraits are made using rangoli techniques. The essence lies in the process and interpretation. Some may not recognize a design as rangoli, but for those who understand the art, it carries deeper meaning.

Aditi: I use an AxiDraw pen plotter. If I ask it to draw a rangoli, is it just imitating one, or is it a real rangoli?

Vijaya: It depends on how you see it. Some people use vibrating plates with powder to create patterns—this is still a form of rangoli. What matters is the intention and interpretation behind it.

Aditi: I worry that integrating technology into rangoli may cause the loss of traditional practices.

Vijaya: I create rangolis on a computer and even made an app for digital rangoli. It depends on who you are teaching and how you engage them. If someone is comfortable with digital tools, they can still learn the designs and their significance. The goal is to preserve and spread awareness. Whether on the floor or a screen, rangoli remains rangoli.

Aditi: Do you feel that younger generations are preserving rangoli?

Vijaya: We can preserve it through exhibitions and workshops. I have held exhibitions in New York, Taiwan, and multiple locations in Singapore. By using different materials and reaching diverse audiences, I am trying to bring rangoli to as many people as possible.

Aditi: This has been a wonderful conversation. Thank you so much for your time!
