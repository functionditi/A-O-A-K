Aditi: Thanks so much for your time today. I've been following your work and research, and I’m really looking forward to hearing your thoughts. I’m very grateful we could set up this meeting, so thanks once again.

Nagarajan: Of course. Anyone interested in the kolam in a deep way, I’m always interested in talking to.

Aditi: Amazing. I’ll start by giving a quick introduction to my research. My name is Aditi, and I’m from Bangalore, India. I grew up half Telugu and half Bengali and moved to Singapore in 2020 to pursue design, studying computational design at LaSalle. Last year, during Deepavali, I found myself drawn to the idea of representing rangolis as a broader artwork or art form through computational means. The more I explored, the more I realized there are so many rule sets that dictate how rangolis, kolams, mugulus, or any pookalams should exist. That got me curious about their creation process. I decided to focus my exploration on the kolam or mugulu. These art forms involve intentionality in every step, from choosing the initial patterns, colors, motifs, and materials to the physical act of making them, which is a highly tactile and sensorial experience. It’s deeply ingrained in cultural significance. My research looks into how human creativity, intentionality, and physicality in these art forms can be expressed through generative design, physical computing, or human-machine interaction while still preserving their integrity. I came across a passage in your work, "Even one's own tradition is not a birthright. It must be earned and possessed. One chooses and translates a part of it, making it present to oneself and maybe to others." This deeply resonated with me. This project feels like rediscovering the practice of making kolams or mugulus, despite my detachment from this aspect of culture. That thought has been a driving force behind my research, so I wanted to say thank you.

Nagarajan: That quote is from one of my mentors, A.K. Ramanujan. He invited me to work with him at the University of Chicago on kolams, but due to circumstances, I couldn’t. However, we maintained a collegial and mentor-mentee relationship. He was a remarkable scholar, a MacArthur Genius Grant recipient, and his Sangam poetic translations are incredible. His perspective on tradition really resonated with me—this idea that tradition isn’t something automatically inherited but something one must actively engage with and understand. It requires mental, physical, and even spiritual effort to grasp the deep histories and complex permutations that exist within these traditions. Especially with kolams, which are primarily passed down orally rather than documented in texts, the knowledge is held by women, though a few men also practice it. The visual and technical knowledge exists in an oral and embodied form, making it incredibly rich and dynamic. I love that you connected with that quote—it really sets the tone for my entire book.

Aditi: Exactly. One of the things I really appreciated about your research is how you speak about kolams from a deeply personal perspective while also amplifying the experiences of the women who practice them daily. You mentioned that many women can even make kolams in the dark because it has become an embodied interaction with the environment around them. That was particularly fascinating to me. I wanted to discuss this further, specifically through the lens of computational design and human-computer interaction. I’m curious, do you think any aspects of the kolam’s embodied or tactile nature might be lost in translation if it becomes screen-based or if the medium shifts to machines?

Nagarajan: That’s a fascinating question. Before answering, I’d like to understand more about what that means for you. What does computational design mean in this context, and what are the entry points for machines into kolam learning or transference?

Aditi: I approached this from two perspectives. First, kolams have a strong mathematical foundation, so I explored algorithmic generation. If you write a program to generate a kolam—let’s say using tile-based systems or array grammars—you can instantly create the image with a click of a button. There is intentionality in writing the code, but the process, the physicality of making it, is lost. That was one aspect I struggled with. Second, I took it further with a pen plotter connected to an Arduino and environmental sensors like a microphone and humidity sensors. These inputs influenced the kolam’s generation. This led me to question the balance of control—how much autonomy do we give the machine to generate the kolam, and to what extent should human elements dictate it? How do we preserve the physicality and intentionality behind actually drawing a kolam when approaching it through code and physical computing?

Nagarajan: I think that’s a really fascinating process. My first reaction is to ask, why? Beyond the fact that we can now do this, what is the purpose? What are we gaining from this translation? There are multiple ways to look at it. One way is to compare algorithmic kolams to plastic stick-on kolams. Both take something three-dimensional or even four-dimensional and flatten it into two dimensions. The stick-on kolam, which lasts for months, removes the ephemeral, daily ritual aspect of the practice. It alters the transient nature of the kolam and its engagement with time, space, and environment. Another crucial aspect is that kolams are not just aesthetics. One of the most knowledgeable people I interviewed in Madurai emphasized this to me repeatedly, "Do not ever forget that the kolam is not just aesthetics." Reducing the kolam to its pattern alone erases its deeper significance. The kolam is a choreographed movement of the body in space, and the physical act of drawing it at dawn is transformative. It marks a shift in time—the transition from darkness to light—and enhances awareness of the world around you. It’s not just about what is drawn but about what happens in the body, mind, and environment while making it. This embodied, daily practice is a form of communication. It signals the household’s openness, its capacity for generosity, and its ability to welcome strangers. This layer of meaning is not captured in a plastic kolam or an algorithmic one.

Aditi: That makes so much sense. This also ties into materiality. Kolams are drawn with rice flour, which feeds insects and small creatures. It’s a way of giving back, of acknowledging that when we build homes, we occupy space that was once home to other beings. If a kolam is generated by a machine or projected on a screen, does it remain a kolam, or does it become merely a representation of one? That’s something I’ve been grappling with.

Nagarajan: That’s a critical question. Kolams are a ritual of generosity, performed on multiple levels. If we limit them purely to algorithmic generation, we lose the ability to step outside the contemporary mindset and gain the knowledge kolams offer us. They have the potential to critique the world we live in, offering alternative ways of seeing and acting. In this era of climate crisis, we need multiple ways of understanding the world, and kolams hold valuable insights that go beyond aesthetics or digital replication.

Nagarajan: It’s made me think deeply about what community means. It makes me reflect on how our actions, including mine, contribute to destruction—of the planet, of life. There is a natural cycle of life and death, but modern culture does not recognize that this cannot be infinite. We do not have the right to take life—whether human, animal, plant, mountain, river—infinitely.

Aditi: That two-dimensional worldview—the flattening of meaning—also ties into the way we perceive climate change.

Nagarajan: Exactly. I'm actually teaching a class on Hinduism and climate change, so I think about this daily. There’s a book I wanted to mention, Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer. Do you know it?

Aditi: No, but I’ll definitely check it out. It sounds like it explores indigenous knowledge as an alternative or complementary approach to modern systems.

Nagarajan: Yes, exactly. And I saw your exhibit on plants—how you connected visitors with plants in a museum setting. That was fascinating. You were re-teaching people how to relate to nature.

Aditi: I didn’t know you had seen that project! That means a lot. The inspiration came from Bangalore, where I grew up. It was once known as the Garden City but has rapidly urbanized. So much of its greenery has been lost to construction and expansion. That led me to think about how we might reconnect people with nature through tactile experiences—especially children. How do we encourage people to literally go outside and touch grass?

Nagarajan: That project was beautiful. Its simplicity gave it power. It was almost shocking in a way, like a reminder that we’ve forgotten the language of nature and now must re-learn it from the ground up.

Aditi: That brings me back to my current research on kolams and computational design. Growing up, I saw how traditional practices in my family gradually faded. Space plays a role—both in Bangalore and Singapore. In Singapore, where I live now, space is scarce. Housing is dense, and public spaces are strictly regulated. For instance, in public housing (HDBs), hallways don’t belong to residents—they’re communal. You can’t place anything outside your door without violating regulations. Even in my condo, we received a notice for leaving our shoes outside. Singapore prioritizes uniformity, and in its attempt to balance multiculturalism, certain traditions are suppressed. This makes me wonder, how can we adapt this practice to dense urban environments like Singapore or Bangalore?

Nagarajan: That’s fascinating. So the space outside your home is essentially no one’s space?

Aditi: Exactly. Unlike traditional Tamil homes, where the kolam at the threshold signals the household’s generosity, here there’s no space for it. This makes me wonder, how can we adapt this practice to dense urban environments like Singapore or Bangalore?

Nagarajan: That’s a really interesting question. I think there’s something about space—if you think about the doormat, for example. I don't know if it's the same in Singapore, but in the United States, people have doormats in front of their homes or apartments. It's acceptable because people need to wipe off snow or mud before entering. But beyond the doormat, there’s usually another space—the kolam space. That’s part of the modern space that doesn’t exist in the same way anymore. I think there's a real loss of tenderness in community life. Sometimes, we need to do things without language. The kolam, in a way, engendered a language of tenderness. If someone wasn’t making a kolam, people would organize to bring food to their house because they probably didn’t have the capacity to cook or take care of themselves. It was an automatic language of need. It’s such a simple thing, and yet, how do you express love? It’s not just by saying, "I love you." It’s through action. Over the past year, I’ve seen how different friends understood what was needed at different moments. Ritual moments that stand outside of modernity make us human—birth, marriage, motherhood, death, these ceremonies exist in every traditional culture and even in modern ones. My children are also coming to this realization with Tamil. Even though their father was Swedish-Norwegian, they feel the need to hold onto Tamil because they know I won’t be around forever. None of us know how long we have. What are we going to leave behind? That’s why I’m glad I took my time writing the kolam book. It’s a book that will stand its ground because of the depth of time it required. People thought I was foolish for taking so long. My dad told me I would never finish it. He passed away before I finished, but on his deathbed, he told me that once I figured out the mathematics of the kolam, he knew I would complete the book. That chapter was incredibly challenging, and I kept avoiding it. Eventually, I had to do it. It took multiple talks and lectures to refine, but it’s now one of my best-known lectures.

Aditi: Your book is definitely going to stand the test of time. I’m working with the Singapore Art Museum, and they are deeply invested in cross-cultural understanding. Your book helps illuminate the beauty and value of the kolam. I’ve seen people engage with it in so many ways, especially online. I read an article recently analyzing the kolam as an eco-feminist practice, and they cited your work extensively. It’s inspiring.

Nagarajan: Thank you, Aditi. That means so much.
