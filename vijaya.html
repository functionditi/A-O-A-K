        How and when did you become involved in creating rangolis in Singapore?
     </p>

    <h3>VIJAYA</h3>
    <p>
    
        I started Rangoli when I was five, learning from my mother. We did it every day outside our house. I was born and brought up in Trichy (Srirangam), a small place. During Margazhi season, we create very elaborate Rangolis, and I used to walk around to see what others drew, noting down designs I didn’t know.

        <br><br>

        When I got married and moved to Mumbai, we lived in a flat, but I still drew a small Rangoli every day outside our door. One of my lecturers at Bombay University noticed my designs and would invite me whenever there were overseas guests or conferences. I’d go to places like hotels or Nehru Planetarium to create Rangolis.

        <br><br>

        I migrated to Singapore with my family in 1992. We lived in a flat, and I continued my daily ritual of drawing a small Rangoli with rice powder each morning. Birds would come and eat the powder, which fulfills one of the core reasons for Rangoli—feeding small creatures.

        <br><br>

        I’m a bit “crazy” about it and read up on why people do it differently in each state of India, and what they call it—Muggu, Kolam, etc. I learned that even in parts of Africa, they make Rangoli-like art with stones.

         <br><br>

        Later, I did my Master’s in Art Therapy at LASALLE in 2006–2007. I started using Rangoli as therapy in hospitals, old folks’ homes, children’s homes, and so on. Since around 2015, I’ve focused on community involvement—teaching a multi-racial community how to do Rangoli. I’ve moved Rangoli from the floor to the table, then from the table to walls, even to the ceiling. It’s still a traditional design, but using contemporary or recycled materials because of the emphasis on sustainability.

            That’s wonderful. The current exhibition, where you’re using Ang Paos in a Rangoli, is a great representation of Singapore’s cross-cultural spirit. What was the process for that exhibit?

            I’ve worked with about 20 organizations. I’m the President of the Rotary Club of Novena now, and even before that, I did many community projects—four or five a year. I like involving the community and using everyday materials: earbuds, toothpicks, spoons, forks, small mirrors, clay pots from India, and so on. I’ve even made a puzzle Rangoli for stroke and dementia patients so they can play while creating art.
    
            <br><br>
    
            During the pandemic, I worked with about 55 community centers and 20 to 25 organizations, teaching them over Zoom how to create flowers with recycled newspapers. Many people couldn’t go out to buy materials, but everyone had newspapers at home. If they didn’t, they could pick them up from community clubs. It was very successful—over 100 organizations participated. My house became like a factory: people would make flowers and send them to me. Then I’d color them, coat them with weatherproof glue—my husband is a chemical technologist and helped develop a special glue—so they can last outdoors for months.

                I look at the crowd or group I’m working with. Often, I work with seniors, people with mental illnesses, or special needs groups. I teach them how to create basic shapes—like rolled Ang Pao roses—then I arrange the overall design, and they paste their flowers or shapes onto it. It’s a way to involve them without requiring them to learn every detail of Rangoli in one day.
          
                  <br><br>
          
                  I’m also a member of the International Flower Carpet Association. I joined in 2022 after I attended the Brussels Flower Carpet event. They do a huge carpet outside the palace—maybe 200 meters long—with thousands of people. The Association’s president saw my work and invited me to join. Since then, I’ve been invited to Japan, Barcelona, Mexico, Italy, Rome, and more.
          
                  <br><br>

                  Recently, I was supposed to go to Florida but couldn’t because Deepavali is a big season for me here in Singapore. I have many community commitments, including working with migrant workers and seniors, so I stay here from Deepavali until Pongal to focus on these programs.

                    You’ve mentioned that creating Rangolis can be very meditative, especially with traditional rice flour or even synthetic colored powder. How long does it take you to create a Rangoli, and what’s your view on its meditative aspect?

                  <p>
                  
                    Symmetry is essential, especially in Pooja. Symmetrical patterns are calming and help you focus because your mind is entirely on the design. It’s almost like yoga—the pinch of the fingers (like a Chin Mudra) when you hold the powder is also significant. Each fingertip corresponds to the five elements (air, water, fire, earth, and ether).
              
                      <br><br>
              
                      The colors stimulate your senses, and completing the design gives emotional happiness and satisfaction. It’s a very holistic process—physical (you bend to draw), mental (you concentrate), and emotional (you feel satisfied at the end).

                        One interesting aspect of Rangoli is its impermanence. Would you say that’s part of its essence?

                        Yes, beauty is temporary—that’s the spiritual concept behind Rangoli. It’s a form of thanksgiving to God. You can’t take it with you, so you bow down to create it, thanking God. It’s also a way to feed small insects like ants and birds if you use rice powder. Traditionally, people used cow dung mixed with water to clean the doorstep before making the Rangoli, which helps repel mosquitoes and cockroaches.
                  
                          <br><br>
                  
                          It’s believed that drawing Rangoli in the morning drives away evil spirits, invites good health, and welcomes Lakshmi (the goddess of wealth) into your home. There are specific designs for specific days—like Padi Kolam on Fridays—and shapes can represent different energies. For instance, squares are seats of Goddess Lakshmi, upward triangles represent male energy, and downward triangles represent female energy.

                            It’s all about how you interpret it and what your purpose is. The design of Rangoli is rooted in nature and tradition—it has lines, dots, symmetry, repetitive patterns, specific meanings. But you can create those patterns in many ways.
                      
                              <br><br>
                      
                              For example, the National Heritage Board (NHB) once paired me, a traditional Rangoli artist, with a product designer. I created a Rangoli, and the designer transformed my designs into fruit bowls and lampshades. It’s still Rangoli at heart because the motifs and patterns come from the original art form, but they’re applied in a contemporary way.

                              <br><br>

                              During the pandemic, I also made what I call the “dancing Rangoli.” It was a commercial project funded by NAC. We placed sensors on the floor—when someone danced, a Rangoli design would appear on the screen in real-time, matching their movements. Children loved it because they could dance and watch the Rangoli take form. People could also color a digital Rangoli, submit it, and then see it “dance.” It’s still Rangoli, just using a digital medium to reach new audiences.

                                A Rangoli is basically a design that’s rooted in tradition and nature—whether you call it Kolam, Muggu, or by any other name. Specific patterns and lines are drawn for specific occasions; they have deep cultural and spiritual significance. However, the essence is the intention and the pattern itself. If you recreate those lines and shapes on a computer, you’re still representing Rangoli.
                          
                                  <br><br>
                          
                                  It’s all about raising awareness. You can make a Rangoli with chalk on the ground or with digital software on a tablet. Either way, people learn the design elements, the cultural context, and the meaning behind it. I’ve done digital Rangolis, where I sketch on a computer and create coloring apps. It’s a way to teach the patterns, the history, the name “Rangoli,” and why we do it.


                          
                                  <br><br>

                                  When I conduct workshops, I always emphasize the name and the tradition. People might only remember, “We did something beautiful,” but I make sure they know, “This is Rangoli, this is what it signifies, and here’s why we do it.”

                                      For instance, if youngsters find digital art more appealing, then I introduce digital Rangoli. If seniors want to do something hands-on, I’ll have them create Rangoli with colored powders or recycled newspapers. The methods can change, but the heart of the art remains the same.
